"20130512074056AApoU85","¿Es correcto que yo gane por equivocación de otro?","Hola <br/>&#13; <br/> Resulta que soy corredor de karting, y la carrera pasada, el piloto que iba delante mio, se equivocó en la ultima vuelta. Había una linea de meta marcada en el pavimento... Era la linea final para el año 2012. El dueño del kartódromo no la borró y la linea de meta 2013 estaba unos 30 metros más adelante. <br/>&#13; <br/>  <br/>&#13; <br/> Mi colega lideró toda la carrera, yo poco podía hacer, ya que aun no recibo una evolución de mi motor. Si no se equivocaba, seguro ganaba la carrera, pero al pasar la linea ""vieja"" (la de 2012) desaceleró y empezó a festejar. <br/>&#13; <br/>  <br/>&#13; <br/> Yo aproveché su error y aceleré... Cuando se dio cuenta, aceleró, pero le hice fuerza y no lo dejé pasar. Resultado: gané la carrera. <br/>&#13; <br/>  <br/>&#13; <br/> Como lidero el campeonato, todos me dijeron que eso no era necesario y comenzaron con esas tonterías que se dicen sobre etica, compañerismo, etc. que con 13 años ya no las creo... Todos decían que había sido tonto pelear en 15 metros una carrera que no podía ganar. Aunque si vamos al caso, si gané. Yo tengo entendido que gana el que llega primero... <br/>&#13; <br/>  <br/>&#13; <br/> ¿Hice mal en ganar? ¿Debería haberlo dejado ganar la carrera? <br/>&#13; <br/>  <br/>&#13; <br/> Mi papá siempre me compra un alfajor luego de cada carrera, pero esta vez no lo hizo y se lo veía triste. Cuando le dije que se alegrara por mi victoria, solo me miró con ojos tristes y me dijo: ""Si, Ramiro ganaste"" (nunca me dice Ramiro, siempre Rami, o Flaquito, de cariño)  y cuando le dije del alfajor, me miró y me dijo: ""No tengo dinero, vamos a casa"" Yo sé que dinero tenía, cargamos combustible antes de ir al kartódromo... <br/>&#13; <br/>  <br/>&#13; <br/> ¿Hice mal en ganar una carrera? ¿A caso no gana el que llega primero? <br/>&#13; <br/>  <br/>&#13; <br/> Gracias.

"20150901063816AAyIx2I","Getting into teaching... Absolutely lost!?","I'm 21 and after applying to uni twice and then not accepting my place due to changing my mind, I believe I finally know what I want to do.  <br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> I want to become a teacher. Preferably teaching early year Secondary school children.  <br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> I have A-levels and college degrees, as well as the standard A-C GCSE grades you need. However, nothing relevant to teaching. I have an idea of the subject I would teach (History/Geography) but would definitely need to revisit these and sharpen up on them.  <br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> I currently have a full-time job close to home and would ideally need to keep this to fund courses etc.  <br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> Open University looks like the ideal solution, but there are so many courses relating to so many different areas, but nothing seems to directly link to secondary school teaching. <br/> <br/> So I guess my question is, what courses do I need to complete, and how would anyone recommend going about this?  <br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> Anyone who has been in a similar situation?  <br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> Cheers.

Sooo many of my dreams come true in one way or another.  <br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> When I was 13 I was raped by my mothers 58 year old boyfriend at the time. I was never really bothered about it. The thought made me feel sick and I knew he had done wrong and given I was so ugly and covered up i didn't blame myself. <br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> I just dreamt that he escaped Prison. He went to my mothers house. I moved away several years ago but when he was not in prison that's where he knew we were. My family were there. I didn't actually see him but they had and the police were already there. Two police bully vans parked on the estate. I saw his car too. I couldn't stop crying I went and sat next to my older sister and burst out crying again I couldnt shut up. I said to her ""I told you he would come after me and you said I was being stupid"". I was crying at that time because my sister is always throwin away my thoughts saying I'm wrong. When I'm asleep I can feel if I'm crying and I was actually crying. Woke up and id been crying.  <br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> I've always thought he would come after me when he got out I mean why wouldn't he, he told me not to tell, he couldn't go to prison ""again"". I think the sentence was 11 or 14 years I really can't remember but it's at least 5 and I'm almost 18. The police said it didn't mean he would have to serve all the years. he might have been released on bail or something. I've never actually worried about it before. I just wanna know what this could mean because I'm super stuck. ","Dream Interpretation, Social Science","OTROS","0","4","ENG"

And I have this crazy idea: the lights would suddenly go out at evening because of power outage, and then, in darkness, I would gently kiss her. <br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> But the power outage must look accidental, not planned. So, how can I stage this? If I would turn on all electric devices at home to overload the system, she would surely notice. Is there any better way? The easiest way would be to flip the switch on the electricity panel in the kitchen, but then the trick would be spoiled. <br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> Can anybody advise me how to (safely) stage power outage with a delay?

The African Humid Period occurred between 14,800 and 5,500 years ago, and was the last occurrence of a ""green Sahara"". Conditions in the Sahara during the African Humid Period were dominated by a strong North African Monsoon, resulting in larger annual rainfall totals compared to today’s conditions. With the increased rainfall, the vegetation patterns North Africa were nothing like what we see today. The majority of the Sahara region for instance was characterized by expansive grasslands, also known steppe. Meanwhile, the Sahel region south of the Sahara was mostly savanna. Today the Sahara region is mostly desert and the Sahel is characterized by steppe conditions. The African Humid Period was also characterized by a network of vast waterways in the Sahara, consisting of large lakes, rivers, and deltas. The four largest lakes were Lake Megachad, Lake Megafezzan, Ahnet-Mouydir Megalake, and Chotts Megalake. Large rivers in the region included the Senegal River, Nile River, Sahabi River, and Kufra River. These river and lake systems provided corridors that allowed many animal species, including humans, to expand their range across the Sahara. ...

I have been wanting to wait only for the fact that I don't feel comfortable naked.

I can't afford and am not old enough to get surgery to remove excess skin so it's really just choosing the lesser of two evils at this point, fat or loose skin.

I was thinking of wearing something strapless so he could pull it down a bit but it would still cover my stomach and what not. Obviously he knows I'm fat, clothes can only hide so much, but I think he will be grossed out to see my body or that he won't be able to stay turned on once he sees me. <br/> <br/> The only issue is it would be his first time and mine so I don't know what he's expecting.

"20151112120605AAJQoJU","Why do people cling to fables* that ""There is no God"", or ""Religion causes war"", while lashing out negatively at those who disagree?","There is no evidence to back up the fable* that there is no God, because people have been reporting finding God for generations. On top of this we have history full of positive changes those people have made when they put their faith in God. Many of their changes bringing positive change for many more around the world. <br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> There is no evidence for the fable* that religion is causes war either. According to Philip and Axelrod’s three-volume Encyclopedia of Wars, which chronicles some 1,763 wars that have been waged over the course of human history. Of those wars, the authors categorize 123 as being religious in nature. Clearly there were over 1500 wars that were not caused by religion. <br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> So why do people cling to these fables*, lashing out negatively at those who disagree, when clearly they are just fables*? <br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> *Fable used in this question is definition 2 of fable: A story not founded on fact. This was added with an asterisk to remind people who have a selective understanding of what context fable is being used in. This is to help them to be sure that they observe the proper definition as used in the question.

He dropped out of high school before we met and hasn't tried to get his GED or go back even though he always talks like he is going to. He also has not had a job since we've met and won't apply at any. He asked me to apply somewhere for him and got so mad when I said no. I know it's shallow but I don't like being with someone who doesn't have any goals and isn't even working or going to school or trying at all. I'm working full time and just recently enrolled in college. I almost did not enroll because he kept complaining about it and saying he'd break up with me if I did. I usually pay for food and dates (even though we rarely go on dates because he never wants to go out) and I am usually the one picking him up from across town so he can come over. And he almost never offers gas money, and when he does he ""forgets"" about it. When he and I first met he always talked about pretty girls and it made me uncomfortable. When we started dating I was insecure about other girls because of that. He had always liked very short, skinny girls and I'm a tall, more curvy girl. So I don't even know where the attraction comes from. Despite knowing how insecure I am about other girls he continues to make jokes and point out girls and say they're hot etc. then when I get mad he acts like I'm overreacting even though he's told me time and time Again he would stop doing that. I've tried to end things a few times when he gets me so upset. ","Pregnancy &amp; Parenting","PERMANENTER","0","8","ENG"

They constantly talk about the last person who left the room and act like high schoolers. (We re mid 20 s) I find it uncomfortable to be around them and no longer feel I can trust my sister in law specifically because of a petty fight where she exclaimed I was lucky I was her sister in law.

We haven t talked much since then but I ve determined I don t like her very much for who she actually is and can tell she has in the past put up a front around me.I am deciding whether I should bow out, suck it up for my brother our something in between.

The house was built in 1971.  Cause states condition appears to be caused by corrosion of the reinforcing steel in the concrete foundation being located too close to the surface.

The typical sounding implantation bleeding spotting, much lighter than a period barely anything and was dark red but mainly brown. Since the spotting stopped (going on 3 days), I ve had mild cramping in my lower abdominal. As of today my period isn t due for another 10 days, so it s too early to test. My typical cycle time is about 32-36 days. Today, I did an ab workout and had pain or much worse cramps than I have felt before. Idk if that could be a sign.

I just started her on cereal (spoon feeding her) right before bed. I don t really measure how much I give her I just let her eat until she is over it. My dr said that would help fill her belly and get her to sleep but she still wakes up 2 times a night. I put her to bed between 8 and 9 after eating cereal and giving her a bottle to fall asleep. She usually wakes up once around 12 or 1 am and get another bottle and sleeps until 4 or 5am and gets another bottle then finally wakes up for the day around 7 or 8. So between the time I actually put her to bed and she wakes up for the day she wakes up 2 times. Am I not feeding her enough cereal to fill her belly? Am I putting her to bed too early?

""La medicina no cura la enfermedad, solamente calma el dolor"" Tambien creo que mi ansiedad despertó causa de mi consumo abrupto de marihuana (Fumaba 2 porros por dia) Fume durante 3 meses seguidos. Quiero que me digan tecnicas para aliviar la ansiedad o algún método. Tengo una inteligencia bastante considerable, gracias a eso me mantengo en pie y evito caer en pánico a causa de la ansiedad. Lo que me molesta es los continuos sentimientos de vacío, malestares, pensamientos horribles, me anticipo demasiado a los hechos, analizo demasiado las cosas, estoy constantemente alerta, etc. La verdad es que nunca pensé sufrir esto a tan corta edad, pero gracias a esto me e dado cuenta de muchisimas cosas que hacía mal en el pasado.
